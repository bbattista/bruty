    """ Class to encapulate a raster that has a history.
    It should be able to get the current raster data and also at a previous point in time.
    Initial thought is to have two sets of history, one based on insertion date and one based on survey date.
    Think of it as a VCS like GIT or SVN.
    Each transaction will be held as a double linked list of deltas between it and the next more recent version of the surface.

    The current raster is correct for both insertion and survey date histories.
    When a survey is inserted the most recent insertion is changed and the current raster updated.
    The survey date history is harder,
    the location of the survey in the linked list must be determined and then the entire more recent history must be changed.
    This is similar to if a survey needs to be revised (due to data quality/reprocessing) and the insertion deltas revised.
    Think of it like a rebase in GIT.
